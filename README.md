Milestone P3: Creative Extension - Tesco Dataset

1. Title: How is food consumption representative/linked/correlated to wards'well-being? To which factors of well-being is food consumption related? 

2. Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, datasets used. What's the motivation behind your project? How do you propose to extend the analysis from the paper? What story would you like to tell, and why? 

- does London organize nutritional prevention for its inhabitants? cooking activities... extend the nutrition awarness program to other british cities? 

3. Research Questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

How can we segment the well-being into different categories of criteria? 
Which factors are indepedent of food consumptions and therefore are not worth of being targeted when trying to improve food habits in an area? 
How can we relate diabetes and obesity prevalence to the well-being of an area? 

4. Proposed dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.

The dataset we will use is from 2013 whereas Tesco is from 2015. However, we can make the assumption that, in two years, well-being cannot drastically change. Therefore, those two datasets can be linked.  

5. Methods
  - data consolidation
  - data merge
  - evaluation of the correlation between the different variables of the merged dataset
  - representation of the obtained variables 
  (- mapping??)

7. Organization within the team
A list of internal milestones up until project milestone P4. Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

8. Questions for TAs (optional)
Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
